                <i>"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and to see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived" -Thoreau</i>

              <p class="ml-5 mt-5">
                Here is a not-so-brief history between my experience with my favorite quote of all time. In my junior American Literature class I had this fascinating teacher...let us call him Mr. Rudy. Towards the middle of the year, we were reading <i>Walden</i>, and at first I did not particularly enjoy it, especially Thoreau's style of writing. But
                Mr. Rudy was amazing in the way that he engaged my thoughts to look past the mundane, superficial words on the page. Maybe I am still naive when I say this: We are told not to judge a book by its cover, but I think most of us still do; the length of the book, the spacing between each line of text, even the text size all play a role in whether a book is appealing when we flip through the first few pages.
                I am guilty of this; however, Mr. Rudy helped me realize that a book's greatness is not attributed to the words on its pages, but attributed to <i>how</i> readers read said book.
              </p>
              <p class="ml-5 mt-5">
                Our memories are just islands in an ocean of oblivion. Think about the last time you read a book and what you remember from it. It could be plot points, but it can also be emotions, moments of learning, or even the environment around you as you read. But most likely you did not remember the entire book word for word, right? Such an obvious assertion blew my mind when I first thought of it. Every great book is relatable, because in the end, all it can provide are snippets of information that we as readers choose to remember from the book, albeit a memorable plot event or
                a tinge of quiet nostalgia. What I
                got out of reading <i>Walden</i>, much thanks to the guidance of Mr. Rudy, was that life is comprised of a set of deliberate choices that we as individuals make. There are 86,400 seconds in a day–604,800 seconds in a week–and although that is a lot of time,
                at the same moment, it is not a lot of time at all. Plus, every second you are reading this is another second past. (don't stop reading just yet, though!)
              </p>
              <p class="ml-5 mt-5">
                So let me end my already long introduction about my reading experience with this: Thoreau went to live in the woods for two years because he wanted to create experiences that were unique to him, and he left afterwards looking to create more. Our lives on this planet is finite, and we have to be curious enough to
                explore what is out there—to live deliberately. I do not want to exaggerate this, but reading <i>Walden</i> has been a turning point of my high school career in the way that it shifted how I perceived the purpose of reading, as well as the purpose of...living. Phew, that was actually a lot. Special thanks to Mr. Rudy for stoking the flame of my curiosity (as well as the best American Lit class ever), and for the person reading this: welcome to my website!

			The entire inspiration behind the creation of this planner is the one problem we all have deep down inside of us: procrastination.
            A couple months ago I watched this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU" target="_blank">TED talk</a> given by a man named Tim Urban, and the things he said were immensely relatable.
            The gist of the talk is that we all have a "rational decision maker" inside of us guiding our every move, but inside the mind of a procrastinator, there is also another actor: the "instant gratification monkey", who
            only sees short term benefit compared to the long-term goals a rational decision maker is able to set and work towards. Urban contends that in a procrastinator's world, this instant gratification monkey will always win, unless
            there is a situation involving an approaching deadline, in which the monkey is scared off, allowing the rational decision maker to take back the wheel. I thought to myself, in the case of homework, is there a way to <i>visualize</i>
            a deadline to curb procrastination tendancies? For the planner, the answer is quite simple: the deadline is the time the user needs to start his or her assignments in order to finish at a reasonable time—their bedtime. This can
            be 10:30, 11:00, or even midnight, but I hypothesize that in most scenarios getting a good night sleep, in theory, is appealing to any student. No one wants to be pulling all-nighters because of Netflix! </li>

          <p>I am an avid and competitive tennis player. However, I always like to find new hobbies to do! I am a tinkerer, and with spare time you can find me doing some sort of mini project with my Arduino set. And as you may be able to tell, I enjoy all things technology, and I am currently teaching myself scalability and server maintenance. I also love to read, and a long-time favorite of mine is "Art of Racing in the Rain" by Garth Stein. Music is also big in my life, with Panic! At the Disco and Coldplay (their older songs including Viva La Vida and The Scientist) being my favorites. I have been recently collecting a variety of albums that I found to be addictive (including Panic! but also from artists like Rich Brian and the Greatest Showman soundtrack). I also have a great summer playlist that I have been playing on repeat! Not to mention the cheering up playlist that is a must after a tough loss in a tournament. Nevertheless, I found that whatever mood I am in, there will always be a song for me.</p>
          <p>However, I am not always so great at keeping myself busy! When I am feeling in the mood, I am a complete sucker for Netflix. Recent shows I have been watching include Person of Interest and The Office. I like to keep the balance between action and comedy! Besides that, I also have gotten into Korean Dramas: Mr. Sunshine is a must for me. Also, with Netflix comes...Youtube! I have been a long-time fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/nigahiga" target="_blank">Nigahiga</a>, and I have recently been following some great and funny tech Youtubers, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/VSympathyV" target="_blank">Jarvis Johnson</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/hellomayuko" target="_blank">Mayuko</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrekHmOnkptxq3gUU0IyfA" target="_blank">Devon Crawford</a>. Honestly, these three have been awe-inspiring to me with their lives in tech, and in many ways they have encouraged me to further pursue my own life in all things technology. Give them a try!</p>
